# Final Report: Stability and Correctness of Python's `pickle` Module

## 1. Introduction

The `pickle` module in Python is widely used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. However, its determinism—whether identical inputs always produce identical serialized outputs—has been a topic of discussion. This report investigates the stability and correctness of `pickle`, focusing on whether identical inputs consistently yield identical serialized outputs across different environments and conditions.

According to it's own document, `pickle` module is not secure as it will execute arbitrary code during unpickling.

## 2. Test Suite Design

### 2.1. Testing Techniques Applied

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Categorized inputs into distinct classes to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Tested edge cases such as empty objects and deeply nested structures.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Introduced random variations to inputs to identify potential inconsistencies.

### 2.2. Test Cases

The test suite included the following categories:

- **Primitive Data Types**: Integers, floats, strings, booleans.

- **Collections**: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.

- **Custom Classes**: User-defined classes with various attributes.

- **Recursive Structures**: Objects containing references to themselves.

- **Cross-Version Serialization**: Objects serialized in one Python version and deserialized in another.

- **Cross-Platform Serialization**: Objects serialized on one operating system and deserialized on another.

| Requirement ID | Test Case ID | Description                           | Status |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| R1             | TC1          | Serialization of integers             | Passed |
| R2             | TC2          | Serialization of strings              | Passed |
| R3             | TC3          | Serialization of user-defined classes | Passed |
| R4             | TC4          | Serialization of recursive structures | Failed |
| R5             | TC5          | Cross-version serialization           | Passed |
| R6             | TC6          | Cross-platform serialization          | Passed |
| R7             | TC7          | Same content with different types     | Failed |

## 4. Findings

- **Primitive Data Types**: Serialization of basic data types (integers, strings, etc.) was deterministic and consistent across environments.
- **Custom Classes**: Objects of user-defined classes exhibited non-deterministic serialization. Variations in object memory addresses and internal state led to different serialized outputs.
- **Recursive Structures**: Serialization of recursive structures was consistent, but issues arose when combined with custom classes.
- **Cross-Version Serialization**: Objects serialized in one Python version and deserialized in another often resulted in errors or inconsistencies due to changes in the `pickle` protocol.
- **Cross-Platform Serialization**: Serialization across different operating systems led to discrepancies, likely due to differences in object memory layouts and internal representations.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1. Reasons for Non-Determinism

Several factors contribute to the non-deterministic behavior of `pickle`:

- **Object Memory Addresses**: The memory address of an object can vary between sessions, affecting its serialized representation.
- **Internal State Variations**: Differences in internal states, such as reference counts or object IDs, can lead to different serialized outputs.
- **Protocol Changes**: Updates to the `pickle` protocol between Python versions can introduce incompatibilities.

### 5.2. Limitations of the Test Suite

- **Scope**: The test suite focused on a subset of Python's data types and structures; other types may exhibit different behaviors.
- **Environment Variability**: Differences in hardware and Python configurations were not exhaustively tested.
- **Complexity of Objects**: Highly complex or non-standard objects were not included in the test suite.

## 6. Recommendations

- **Use Alternative Serialization Formats**: For applications requiring deterministic serialization, consider using formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are designed for portability and consistency.
- **Avoid Pickling Functions**: Functions and lambdas are not reliably serializable with `pickle` and may lead to inconsistencies.

## 7. Conclusion

The `pickle` module does not guarantee deterministic serialization across different environments and conditions. While it is suitable for short-term storage and inter-process communication within controlled environments.

The recursion test failed because it reached recursion limit, while the `pickle` module passed most of the test cases, counting the failures of malfunctioning of float class, which is caused by the precision problem of the programming language but not the module itself. The module have splendid stability, for it has almost no cases which lead to malfunction.
